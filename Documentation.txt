The registration program for Frozen Plains consists of three parts.

Part 1
From the home page, you can go to either register or login.
Choosing Login, you enter your username and password and if it matches a current user, you can get in to see the coming soon page.

Part 2
There is one Admin.
u: admin
p: frozen101

If you log in as an admin, you'll see a link to Edit Members.
On this page, you'll see the list of members and links to verify or unverify the members.

If you verify a member, an email will be sent to the email address telling them that they have been verified.


Part 3
On the registration page, there is a form. When you submit the form, it checks to see if you are using a username that is already in use. If you aren't, it will add you to the database and tell you to wait for the email.
At this point, the admin would have to log in and verify the user.
